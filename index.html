<h2>Pathway to sustainable 2050: Mobility in Pittsburgh</h2>

<p>WBCSD scenario: In this 2050 scenario, low carbon fuels become mainstream. Hydrogen, electric, and gas plug-in hybrid dominate. Airplanes and ships run on biofuels instead of traditional fossil fuels. Vehicle CO2 emissions are 30% below 2005 levels, and road fatalities are reduced to near zero.</p>

<p>How it would play out in Pittsburgh: People would generally live near where they work, reducing commutes, congestion, carbon, and fuel use. When people do drive, they can use shared cars or taxi services.</p>

<p>For these people, biking becomes popular, as well as electric bicycles and other small personal transportation options. Pittsburgh's hills make it a prime testing ground for new small-scale transit assists, like bike escalators [<a href="http://twistedsifter.com/2014/07/the-bike-escalator-lift-in-norway/">11</a>]. This opens up the ability to get around on a personal device to many old, young, lower economic status, and less physically able people who previously had limited mobility.</p>

<p>Some people cannot live centrally, because the size of the core city is fixed by the rivers and mountains, and it would be difficult to fit 40% more people in the city. For those people, buses are frequent and reliable, and run on clean fuel. Also, the T is extended to the West, South, and North, to better connect those parts of the city and because it's easier to dig there.</p>

<h2>Signs today in Pittsburgh</h2>

<h3>Signs that show that we're heading toward this future:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Moving to the city: Lawrenceville prices are jumping, as are other walkable neighborhoods like Shadyside. Friendship and East Liberty, formerly somewhat poorer communities, are seeing a ton of investment. Developers are targeting the Strip District for redevelopment, particularly the Produce Terminal [<a href="http://pittsburghpa.gov/district7/buncher">7</a>]. Young people want to move into the city.</li>
<li>Electric cars: The electric garage by CMU. Smart car center on Baum Blvd [<a href="http://www.smartcenterpittsburgh.com/new/electric">1</a>]. Installation of Stage II charging stations [<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/07/10/Pennsylvanians-push-for-more-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/stories/201307100136">4</a>] in Pittsburgh, and even outside the city [<a href="http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/3179325-74/charging-electric-station">6</a>], which lessens the "range anxiety" that keeps people from buying electric cars.</li>
<li>Self-driving cars: Some research is going on at CMU in this direction by Raj Rajkumar and his group [<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2013/september/sept4_selfdrivingcar.html">5</a>], which means that testing (or driving) self-driving cars will likely be possible soon.</li>
<li>Bikes: More bike lanes continue to be installed, such as on Liberty Ave, in Schenley Park, and on three bridges [<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2014/09/03/Fitzgerald-announces-new-bike-lanes-on-Pittsburgh-bridges/stories/201409030280">8</a>]. Mayor Bill Peduto is a fan of bikes. Bike commuting continues to grow [<a href="http://bikeleague.org/content/updated-bike-commute-data-released">9</a>], and new proposals are thrown around, such as a bike lane on the busway [<a href="http://www.nextpittsburgh.com/city-design/busways-neville-trail-makes-something-out-of-nothing/">10</a>].</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs that show the opposite:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hydrogen cars seem farther away globally [<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/04/05/1422411/study-hobbled-by-high-cost-hydrogen-fuel-cells-will-be-a-modest-3-billion-market-in-2030/">3</a>], and in the Pittsburgh region as well.</li>
<li>Self-driving cars have traveled thousands of miles with zero accidents, but those cars are also seeing difficulties that they may not be able to overcome [<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/10/google_self_driving_car_it_may_never_actually_happen.html">2</a>]. </li>
<li>Buses are losing funding.</li>
</ul>
