## Pathway to sustainable 2050: Mobility

In this 2050 scenario, low carbon fuels become mainstream. Hydrogen, electric, and gas plug-in hybrid dominate. Airplanes and ships run on biofuels instead of traditional fossil fuels. Vehicle CO2 emissions are 30% below 2005 levels, and road fatalities are reduced to near zero.

## Signs today

We're starting to see some electric cars and plug-in hybrids like the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt, and Toyota Prius plug-in models. In addition, models like Tesla, BMW, and Porsche are making high-end aspirational models. 

Hydrogen cars seem farther away.

Near-zero road fatalities is an ambitious goal. Presumably they're referring to self-driving cars, which have traveled thousands of miles with zero accidents, but those cars are also seeing difficulties that they may not be able to overcome ([slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/10/google_self_driving_car_it_may_never_actually_happen.html)). Perhaps they're also talking about increaed bicycling and bike safety.

Airplanes running on biofuels seems ambitious as well.
